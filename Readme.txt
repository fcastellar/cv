Curriculum Vitae Web Application
Author: Fernando Castellar Mendez


This small application shows information saved in a database called "cv". The information to connect with the database should be written in init.php file.

It's a simple application, well structured, and I tried everytime not to make it pretty complex (there is no validaton for written data or treatment of exceptions, in order to make it as simplest as I could).

I think it's a small example of what I'm able to do. I didn't use any framework just to show my skills better, and I only got the help of jQuery, jQuery-ui and a couple functions from PHP.js (utf_encode and sha1).

Is neede just to import the cv.sql file (it will create the database structure and fill it with information) and write the right info in init.php.

Thank you for your interest and your time.
Best regards.
